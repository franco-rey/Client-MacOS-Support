## New for Mac

> [!NOTE]
> The macOS release is focused on ensuring core gameplay functionality. Custom map background-video support is currently unstable on macOS and does not block gameplay.

Public macOS releases are intended to be signed and notarized. Until that is in place, the prerelease `.app` is only ad-hoc signed, so macOS will refuse to open it on first launch with a "*Rhythia can't be opened*" dialog.

To open it the first time, do one of the following:

- **Right-click** (or Control-click) `Rhythia.app` → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog that appears. After this, normal double-clicking works.
- Or, in Terminal, strip the quarantine attribute:
  ```sh
  xattr -cr /Applications/Rhythia.app
  ```

### Building the .app from source

With the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed, from the project root:

```sh
# 1. Export the .app via Godot headless
godot --headless --export-release "macOS" ./build/Rhythia.app

# 2. Re-sign ad-hoc with the system codesign (required for the bundle to launch)
codesign --force --deep --sign - ./build/Rhythia.app
```

If `godot` isn't on your `PATH`, substitute the full path to the Godot Mono binary — typically `/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`.
